In the case of testing a private cloud a configuration file can be used to create cases that require root access to the machines.\r\nThe config file describes a few things about the clouds configuration including the bare metal machine configuration and IPs.\r\n\r\nThe `eucaops` class can be imported in order to use pre-defined routines which validate common operations on the cloud:\r\n\r\n    from eucaops import Eucaops\r\n\r\nConstructor\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe basic constructor can be used for 2 different connections:\r\n\r\n1. Private cloud with root access - CLC SSH, Cloud, and Walrus connections  \r\n    Purpose - connect to and manipulate Eucalyptus components using boto and command line. Recommended to use Eucaops.  \r\n    Required arguments: root password, config file with topology information  \r\n    Optional arguments: credential path so that new credentials are not created\r\n\r\n        private_cloud = Eucaops( password=\"my_root_pass\",  config_file=\"cloud.conf\")\r\n        private_cloud.sys(\"euca-describe-availability-zones\") ### use local credentials to determine viable availability-zones\r\n        \r\n        \r\n2. Public cloud - local SSH, EC2 and S3 connections  \r\n    Purpose - can be used to wrap euca2ools commands installed locally on the tester machine or with Eucaops  \r\n    Required arguments: credential path\r\n\r\n        public_cloud = Eucaops(credpath=\"~/.eucarc\")    \r\n        public_cloud.run_instance(image) ## run an m1.small instance using image\r\n        \r\n            \r\n \r\nConfig file\r\n----------\r\n    NETWORK MANAGED\r\n    clc.mydomain.com CENTOS 5.7 64 REPO [CC00 CLC SC00 WS]    \r\n    nc1.mydomain.com VMWARE ESX-4.0 64 REPO [NC00]\r\n\r\nNetwork\r\n------\r\nPossible values are MANAGED, MANAGED-NOVLAN, SYSTEM, or STATIC\r\n\r\nColumns\r\n------ \r\n    IP or hostname of machine  \r\n    Distro installed on machine  \r\n    Distro version on machine  \r\n    Distro base architecture\r\n    System built from packages (REPO) or source (BZR), packages assumes path to eucalyptus is /, bzr assumes path to eucalyptus is /opt/eucalyptus\r\n    List of components installed on this machine encapsulated in brackets []\r\n\r\nThese components can be:\r\n\r\n    CLC - Cloud Controller   \r\n    WS - Walrus   \r\n    SC00 - Storage controller for cluster 00   \r\n    CC00 - Cluster controller for cluster 00    \r\n    NC00 - A node controller in cluster 00   "}
